[2026-02-28 01:57:38.938899] You
[2026-02-28 02:02:18.096054] Take this evening off with a favorite story of mine.
[2026-02-28 02:04:14.237140] used to always tell me something which I want to share with you that why do you
[2026-02-28 02:08:36.524076] To break to shatter anything all I wanted was to chase my dream
[2026-02-28 02:11:48.006663] into a box. As if my ambition was, Kire, I want to find a glass
[2026-02-28 02:11:52.730447] feeling and break it. Not at all. To be really honest, I was never in a
[2026-02-28 02:11:57.575103] to break, to shatter anything, all I wanted was to chase my
[2026-02-28 02:12:02.450545] dreams, my ambitions, I want to evolve, I want
[2026-02-28 02:12:07.868448] wanted to become the best version of me that I could be, and of course, in Priya...
[2026-02-28 02:12:12.827700] Kachopra style along the way I wanted to smash and break every obstacle that came my way which
[2026-02-28 02:12:17.721746] I did, but that does not mean that the glass ceiling doesn't exist.
[2026-02-28 02:12:22.664525] Of course it exists, and countless of women and men, mostly women,
[2026-02-28 02:12:28.169524] in, run into it in their professional and personal lives and I'm sure a lot of you can vouch for that.
[2026-02-28 02:12:32.274853] right now the Oxford dictionary definition
[2026-02-28 02:12:37.814038] of the glass ceiling is an unacknowledged barrier to advance.
[2026-02-28 02:12:42.503217] advancement in a profession especially affecting women and members
[2026-02-28 02:12:47.979009] minorities from rising beyond a certain level in a hierarchy.
[2026-02-28 02:12:53.018973] And this metaphor was first coined by feminists in reference to barriers.
[2026-02-28 02:13:26.533776] It as my topic for today if I hated it so much because I hope
[2026-02-28 02:13:31.401387] Through my experiences, I can present to you the tools to
[2026-02-28 02:13:36.488596] your dream and to not make that glass ceiling that is defined by so
[2026-02-28 02:13:41.149889] society largely patriarchal as your goal.
[2026-02-28 02:13:47.090863] I want you to aim higher because you know you can.
